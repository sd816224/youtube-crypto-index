BlackRock will probably switch to a big bank as custodian at some point for its ETF, and the big tech companies will also seek to get in on the action.\n\nAlso, because Bitcoin is proof of work, owning more coins does not give you more control over the protocol, unlike proof of stake.\n\nNot investment advice!
